## 🎬 Quick Demo Flow

### Step 1: Show Healthy (Green)
```
Open: http://localhost:8501
Point to: Success Rate 99%, all banks <200ms
Say: "Everything is optimal, system is green"
```

### Step 2: Trigger Chaos
```
Click: 💥 BREAK HDFC
Watch: Red line spikes to 600ms on chart
Say: "HDFC is now degraded, simulating real-world failure"
```

### Step 3: AI Responds
```
Click: 🔄 Run Analysis Now
Point to: Sentinel Mind sidebar
Read: "HDFC latency spiked to 600ms. Rerouting traffic to ICICI"
Say: "AI detected the issue and is taking autonomous action"
```

### Step 4: Customer Protection
```
Open: http://localhost:8502
Show: HDFC has "⚠️ Slow - Not Recommended" badge
Show: ICICI has "⚡ Recommended" badge
Select HDFC: Red warning appears
Select ICICI: Green success message
Say: "Customers are guided away from problem banks in real-time"
```

### Step 5: Recovery
```
Back to dashboard
